# ARTIST
The Algorithmic Real-time Image-based Selective Technology

An attepmt to make a genetic algoritm to be used as part of a school art exibition.
Uses a Raspberry Pi 2 connected to five 24mm arcade buttons with built-in LEDs to interface with a Genetic-Algorithm informed process (i.e. a bunch of spaghetti code loosely inpired by genetic algorithims) to make a personalized piece of art for the user.
