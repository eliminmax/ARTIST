# ARTIST
The Algorithmic Real-time Image-based Selective Technology

An algorithmic system written in Processing to create simple, abstract designs, and improve on them to create something fine-tuned to the user's tastes.

ARTIST used a Raspberry Pi 2 connected to five 24mm arcade buttons with built-in LEDs to interface with the ARTIST algorithm to make a personalized piece of simple art for the user.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: I MADE THIS AS A HIGH SCHOOL ART PROJECT, AND I DO NOT INTEND TO MAINAIN IT.**
